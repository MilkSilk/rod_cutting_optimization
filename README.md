# rod_cutting_optimization
Small side project made while working on an assignment for discrete optimization class.

A python script returns the number of all possible ways of cutting a rod of a given length into pieces and description of how many pieces of each cut should be made, the available piece lengths are also declared.

The code isn't well commented or written most efficiently - it's just a snippet which allowed me to solve the issue the quickest instead of iterating the cut finding algorithm by hand.
